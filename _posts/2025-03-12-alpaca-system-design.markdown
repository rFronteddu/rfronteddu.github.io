## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post! This is an example where I will walk you through adding figures and describing what's going on.

### Figure 1: A Cool Graph

Here is a cool graph that shows some data:

![Graph 1](https://github.com/rFronteddu/rfronteddu.github.io/blob/main/img/alpaca_arch_1.png)

This graph represents some important data that I want to share with you.

### Figure 2: A Beautiful Diagram

Here's a diagram illustrating the concept in more detail:

This diagram helps to visualize the different elements and how they interact.

### What's Going On?

This blog post is a demonstration of how you can add images and content to your Jekyll blog. You can use Markdown syntax to include headings, lists, images, and more.

If you want to add more figures, just repeat the pattern above. You can also include external images by linking them directly.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
