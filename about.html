			<h2>Education</h2>
			<p>
				I started High School in Ravenna (Italy) where I got
				my secondary school diploma in Electronic and Telecommunications 
				with a dissertation about wind energy applications. I feel like I
				always had a passion for I.T. but it took me a while to find a learning
				method that would suit me. Luckily I had wonderful teachers 
				there that pushed me to become a better person, I will always
				be grateful for that. After High School I moved to Ferrara 
				(Italy) and got my Bachelor degree in I.T. and Automation 
				Engineering (Thesis: Study and realization of a Task Controller 
				Client ISO 11783) and finally my Master degree in I.T. Engineering.
				(Thesis: A Network-Aware Middleware for Tactical Networks).

			<h2>Life</h2>	
			<p>
				I feel like I always had a lot going on in my life. I changed 
				living place multiple times over the years and that gifted me 
				with the many different people I met and lived with. I also did 
				many jobs during my studies in very different fields (I was a 
				farmer, a barman, a programmer, a home teacher, a lab 
				assistant, and finally a software developer). All these 
				experience and encounters made me into the person that I am 
				today and I will always be grateful for all the opportunities 
				that I had in my life. Currently I live in Pensacola (FL) 
				(under a J1 Visa) and I work for IHMC as a Research Associate. 
				My job consists in solving problems related to military 
				networks mainly by researching and implementing novel 
				approaches to network monitoring and communication middleware 
				adaptation.

			<h2>Scientific Interests</h2>	
			<p>
				Other than networking, I am also interested in embedded 
				solutions (mainly ARM platform for automotive applications), 
				A.I. (swarm robots’ intelligence, Prolog applications),
				and applications of game making (problem solving by 
				“gamification” and the UNITY engine).

			<h2>Free Time</h2>	
			<p>
				In my free time I enjoy hanging out, going to the beach, 
				and to concerts. I read and listen to a lot of music 
				(mainly classics and Post Rock recently, I also play 
				and write but I don’t really have a lot of time to dedicate to 
				these hobbies too). This year I started Karate again after a 
				two years stop and I am now training for my second Dan! Other 
				passions include Netflix Binge Watching and cooking. This 
				summer I hope to learn a bit of surfing and hopefully 
				I will start playing Tabletop Games again!
