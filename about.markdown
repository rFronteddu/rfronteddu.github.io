# Roberto Fronteddu


Hi there! I'm a software engineer and researcher with over 9 years of experience in building full-stack solutions across various platforms, including Linux, Windows, and mobile environments. Currently, I’m a Research Associate at IHMC in Pensacola, FL, where I design and deploy software applications and contribute to research by writing articles and presenting at conferences. I hold a Doctorate in Computer and Information Science from the Università degli studi di Ferrara, Italy.

In terms of tech, I specialize in distributed systems and have experience with a variety of languages and tools, including Java, Golang, Rust, Python, and C/C++. I’m passionate about solving complex problems and building efficient systems.

When I’m not coding or researching, you can find me practicing Shotokan Karate, dancing West Coast Swing, playing electric guitar, or attempting to learn how to draw. Always looking to try new things and keep learning!
